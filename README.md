## General Desc

The primary goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating improved versions of argumentative texts. 
Specifically, this project focuses on the task of _inappropriateness mitigation_, i.e., rewriting arguments to make them more appropriate while preserving the original meaning. 

The key areas of exploration include:

- **Zero-shot Prompting:** Utilizing the LLM's pre-trained knowledge without providing any additional examples related to the task.
- **Few-shot Prompting:** Supplying a small number of examples to guide the LLM in generating improved texts.
- **Personas in Text Generation:** Experimenting with generating text from different perspectives or voices (personas) to see how it affects the output.
